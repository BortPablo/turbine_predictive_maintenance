# Predictive maintenance for wind turbines

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for the final master thesis project of the MSc. Big Data Analytics at Universitat Polit√©cnica de Valencia and is focused on the development of a predictive maintenance system for wind turbines. The methodology used is described in the thesis [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PW2BmiOykbafdPJOVP3f42tXJhEdpf69/view?usp=drive_link) (in Spanish). The thesis was graded with a 9.5/10.

This project is a continuation of the master thesis project, and the main goal is to improve the models and methodology used in the thesis.

## Data

The data used for this project is the [HTW 2018: Wind Turbine Failures Detection](https://opendata.edp.com/open-data/en/hack-the-wind.html) dataset. The data is available in the `data/raw` folder of this repository.

## Code

MLflow is used to track the experiments and the models. The code is available in the `src` and `notebooks` folders of this repository.
